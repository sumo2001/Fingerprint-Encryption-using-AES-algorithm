As we are in the world where technology plays an important role in our day to day life, we were daily transforming towards digital life where security plays an important role so we need to enhance more security and the only thing unique for everyone and its very hard to hack is our finger print where we implemented fingerprint as our key and one more factor that is very essential and important is encryption algorithms there are many methods available around like AES ,DES,RSA and many more here the existing method is DES and proposed method is AES where it is more secure and compilation time for AES is less when compared with DES as shown in the above graph so that we can conclude that fingerprint encryption is more unique and more secure and faster.
